The aging U.S. population is the obvious macro driver—by 2030, over 20% of Americans will be 65 or older [1], and demand for facility- and home-based care will outpace the system’s capacity. But the more compelling opportunity lies beneath the surface: LTC providers still operate with manual workflows, fragmented tooling, and brittle labor models. Staff shortages, regulatory complexity, and increasing acuity have exposed the limitations of legacy systems designed decades ago.\n\n<div class=\"text-center\">![Image](/uploads/build-thesis-long-term-care-test/1753901192499.png)</div>\n\nWhile parts of the industry—especially in SNFs—have seen software adoption, much of the day-to-day operational core remains underserved. Most tooling focuses on documentation or billing. Few products are built for workflows that break down every day: staff coverage, audit readiness, family communication, onboarding, and in-facility coordination."

Then she goes back to her notebook and group text thread—because those still work.\n\nIf you want her attention, solve one problem. Today. Help her cover a shift without six texts. Show her what’s missing before the inspector does. Let her update a family without logging into something new.\n\nShe doesn’t want features. She wants fewer fires. And if your product solves one this week, she’ll trust you next week. That’s how decisions get made in this market: through quiet utility.\n\nCarol isn’t unique. Her day reflects the operational reality across most LTC segments. But the challenges—and opportunities—differ by setting.\n\nWhat follows is a structural breakdown of the major subsegments, their workflow maturity, and where software fits—and doesn’t.\n"

        "content": "**1.\tSNFs Are the Most Tooled, But Not Fully Solved**\nSkilled Nursing Facilities have high software penetration—EHRs like PointClickCare dominate, and layers like Quick MAR, OnShift, and SmartLinx exist. But many workflows are still partially manual (e.g., training tracking, shift call-offs, incident response). SNFs also have compliance-heavy needs and budget, but they are not greenfield.\n\n\n\n<div class=\"text-center\">![Image](/uploads/build-thesis-long-term-care-test/1753901417718.png)</div>\n\n\n\n**2.\tAssisted Living Facilities (ALFs) Are Mixed**\nLarger ALFs (50+ beds) behave more like SNFs—they have budget, multi-site ownership, and regulatory exposure. But ALFs also span down into fragmented, operator-owned sites with little tooling. Family communication, staff onboarding, and activity scheduling are rarely digitized, even in well-resourced ALFs.\n\n**3.\tBoard & Care and Home Health Have High Friction**\nThese segments are deeply underserved, often still using binders, texting, and spreadsheets. But they are hard to monetize buyers are price-sensitive, tech-skeptical, and fragmented. This makes them unattractive for standalone software—unless GTM is highly optimized.\n\n**4.\tHospice Is Separate, but Closely Related to Home Health**\nHospice care is palliative, often end-of-life, and usually Medicare-funded. It is operationally distinct from home health, which is outcome-driven and rehabilitative. Yet both segments rely heavily on nurse routing, visit tracking, medication coordination, and interdisciplinary documentation. While software adoption is low, trust and emotional stakes are high.\n\n**5.\tWorkflow Ownership Is Critical**\nAcross segments, the same few personas control key workflows: Executive Directors, DONs, Regional Ops, Admins, and Compliance Officers. The most viable wedges target workflows owned by these buyers—especially ones with urgency and compliance or labor implications.\n"

        "content": "LTC software is clearly fundable — capital has flowed across clinical, operational, and engagement categories. But adoption has lagged behind investment. The problem hasn’t been demand — it’s been fit. The companies that gained real traction focused on urgent, regulated workflows. The ones that stalled misunderstood how fragmented, time-starved, and structurally limited most operators actually are.\n\n**The wins are clear:**\n\n• **PointClickCare** anchored to billing, audits, and compliance. It became essential infrastructure in SNFs and received a minority investment from  Hellman & Friedman valuing PCC at ~$4B. [2]\n• **Relias** scaled through mandatory training with minimal onboarding friction. It sold for ~$500M. [3]\n• **AlayaCare** focused on visit tracking and care routing in home health. It raised $294M and generated an estimated $100M in 2024 revenue. [4]\n• **Axxess**, a bootstrapped home health platform, reached ~$525M in revenue without outside capital through a lightweight, self-serve approach. [4]\n• **SmartLinx**, ($6M raised, ~$19M revenue) [5] was a success by private equity standards, completing a full PE cycle with Marlin Equity and exiting to Lone View Capital, followed by continued growth through strategic acquisitions.\n\n**Others didn’t convert:**\n\n• **Caremerge ($25M raised):** Built around family communication and engagement, but failed to tie value to operational outcomes. Quietly acquired by VoiceFriend.\n• **Silversheet ($10M raised):** Automated credentialing, but never embedded in daily workflows. Acquired by AMN Healthcare with limited post-acquisition traction.\n• **OnShift ($34M raised) **: Scheduling tool that couldn’t scale beyond large enterprise SNFs. Sustained operations, but has shown limited evidence of scale, exit, or significant investor returns.\n• Several bundled “platform” plays ($5–15M raised): Attempted to combine EHR, CRM, and billing but lacked a clear wedge and struggled to implement.\n• In ALFs and Board & Care, basic scheduling still lives on whiteboards and group texts—despite funding in the category.\n\n\n<div class=\"callout-block\">\n\nThe signal is clear: capital has entered, but usage only follows where tools solve something painful, habitual, and owned by someone with decision power. This isn’t an underfunded category—it’s an under-fit one. The opportunity is wide open for products that start narrow, embed deeply, and grow only after they’ve earned trust. EHRs may capture documentation, but they leave much of the operational core—shift coverage, audit prep, medication coordination—untouched.\n\n</div>"

Think shift coverage tools that actually fill the gap, not just display it. These models earn trust by directly solving high-friction workflows. Over time, they create credibility that supports horizontal expansion into adjacent areas like credentialing, scheduling, or compliance. It’s a harder business to run, but a much stickier one."
