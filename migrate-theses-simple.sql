But the more compelling opportunity lies beneath the surface: LTC providers still operate with manual workflows, fragmented tooling, and brittle labor models. Staff shortages, regulatory complexity, and increasing acuity have exposed the limitations of legacy systems designed decades ago."}}'::jsonb,
